# wine-quality-classifier

- Wine quality classifier using xgboost library.
- XGBoost builds models by combining weak learners (decision trees) into a strong learner through an additive process, optimizing the model using gradient descent.
- Confusion matrix to compute accuracy
- You need basic understanding of vector calculus, partial derivatives and gradient descent for a conceptual understanding of gradient boosting
